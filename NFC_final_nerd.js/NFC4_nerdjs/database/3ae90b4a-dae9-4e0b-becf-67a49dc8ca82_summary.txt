Randolph Carter's life is marked by loss of wonder and beauty. He once explored ancient cities and dreamlands, but as he aged, his experiences became shallow and meaningless. He tried to find meaning in science, philosophy, and even occultism, but all were empty and hollow.

Carter's dreams faded, replaced by a sense of ennui and despair. He felt trapped between the world of reality and the world of dreams. His grandfather appeared to him, speaking of their family's ancient line and the secrets they held.

The key to unlocking the lost gate of dreams was revealed: an antique box containing a great silver key. Carter found the box in his attic, and as he opened it, he felt himself being pulled back into the past.

He returned to his childhood home, where memories of his youth flooded back. He walked through the woods, feeling the magic of the landscape, and eventually arrived at the old Carter place.

There, he encountered Old Benijah Corey, a familiar voice from his boyhood visits. The encounter sparked a sense of wonder and possibility, hinting that there may be more to life than the mundane reality he had grown accustomed to.
